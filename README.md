# Working_with_LLMs

Working with LLMs has been an enriching journey, unlocking powerful tools for AI-driven solutions. Iâ€™ve explored various techniques and processes, which Iâ€™ve documented and shared on my GitHub. Hereâ€™s a quick rundown of what Iâ€™ve learned:



##Core Skills and Techniques



ðŸ”¹ Using a Pipeline for Summarization: Simplifying lengthy texts into concise summaries.

 ðŸ”¹ Generating Text: Crafting coherent, context-aware text outputs.

 ðŸ”¹ Translating Text: Enabling seamless multilingual communication.

 ðŸ”¹ Fine-Tuning LLMs: Customizing pre-trained models to fit specific use cases.

 ðŸ”¹ Mapping Tokenization: Managing token splits to ensure accuracy and efficiency.

 ðŸ”¹ Setting Up Training Arguments: Defining parameters for effective model training.

 ðŸ”¹ Setting Up the Trainer: Streamlining the training process for optimal results.



##Evaluation and Metrics


ðŸ”¹ Loading Metrics with Evaluate: Seamlessly integrating evaluation metrics into workflows.

 ðŸ”¹ Evaluating Perplexity: Measuring model understanding and language generation quality.

 ðŸ”¹ BLEU for Translations: Assessing the accuracy of generated translations.

 ðŸ”¹ ROUGE Metric: Evaluating summarization quality by comparing key text overlaps.

 ðŸ”¹ Exact Match (EM): Scoring precision in information retrieval or QA tasks.

 ðŸ”¹ Toxicity in LLMs: Identifying and mitigating biases in generated content.

This exploration has been both challenging and rewarding, sharpening my expertise in building scalable, ethical, and high-performing AI systems.
